## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- `conda` (recommended) or `pip`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prabathjayatissa/Data-Science.git
    cd Data-Science
    ```

2. **Set up the environment (using Conda - Recommended):**
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate bioinfo_ds_env  # Or whatever you name your environment in the YAML file
    ```

   *Alternatively, using pip:*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üìä Datasets

This repository works with the following types of bioinformatics data.  
Due to size constraints, raw data is often not stored in Git.

| Dataset | Description | Source | Size | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TCGA-BRCA** | RNA-Seq and clinical data for Breast Cancer | The Cancer Genome Atlas | ~2 GB | [GDC Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) |
| **Human Genome (GRCh38)** | Reference genome sequence | GENCODE | ~1 GB | [GENCODE](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/) |
| **Example Microbiome** | 16S rRNA sequencing data from a mock community | [Cite Source] | ~50 MB | [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.xxxx/zenodo.xxxxx.svg)](https://doi.org/10.xxxx/zenodo.xxxxx) |

> **Pro Tip:**  
> - Use tables for clarity.  
> - Always provide a source and link (DOI if available).  
> - Mention the size to set expectations.  
> - For large datasets, provide scripts in `scripts/data_download/` to automate fetching.

### Data Download Scripts

Run the provided scripts from the repository root to fetch data:

```bash
# Example: Download and preprocess TCGA data
bash scripts/data_download/fetch_tcga_data.sh

# Example: Download a reference genome
python scripts/data_download/get_reference_genome.py
```
